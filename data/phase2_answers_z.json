Weigh coin 12 against a good coin to determine if it's heavier or lighter.\n*   **If the scale tips:** The counterfeit is among coins 9, 10, or 11. The direction of the tip tells you if the counterfeit is heavier or lighter.\n\n**Weighing 3 (if Scenario 2 from Weighing 2):**\nSuppose coins 9, 10, 11 are suspect and you know if the counterfeit is heavier or lighter. Place coin 9 on one side and coin 10 on the other.\n\n*   **If the scale balances:** Coin 11 is the counterfeit, and you already know if it's heavier or lighter.\n*   **If the scale tips:** The heavier side contains the heavier counterfeit, or the lighter side contains the lighter counterfeit.\n\n**Weighing 2 (if Scenario 2 from Weighing 1: scale tipped):**\nLet's assume Group A (1,2,3,4) was heavier than Group B (5,6,7,8).

Leave 4 coins aside (Group C).\n- If they balance, the counterfeit is in Group C.\n- If not, the counterfeit is in the heavier or lighter group (A or B).\n\n**Second Weighing:**\n- **If Group C is counterfeit:** Weigh 3 coins from Group C against 3 known genuine coins (from A or B).\n  - If they balance, the remaining coin is counterfeit. Weigh it against a genuine coin to see if it’s heavier or lighter.\n  - If not, the counterfeit is among the 3, and you know if it’s heavier or lighter based on the tilt.\n- **If Group A or B is counterfeit:** Take 3 coins from the suspect group and weigh 1 from that group against 1 from the other, swapping one and adding a known genuine coin.\n  - The change in balance will reveal the counterfeit and its weight difference.\n\n**Third Weighing:** Weigh the suspect coin(s) against a genuine one to confirm which is counterfeit and whether it’s heavier or lighter. This method guarantees identification in 3 weighings.",

Lina crouches beside the old gingko tree at the market’s edge, its silver-veined leaves pulsing faintly blue—data streams shimmering just beneath the epidermis. She presses her palm to the bark, feeling the familiar vibration as her neural lace syncs with the tree’s root-node. A whisper of information brushes her mind: weather updates, transit delays, a missing child alert. The city breathes through its foliage.\n\nThen, a glitch. The leaves darken, veins flaring crimson. A memory not her own surges forward—grainy, visceral: a protest years ago, bodies pressed against this same trunk as riot drones sprayed bio-suppressants. The tree had recorded it all, stored in its rings like a secret. Lina gasps, yanking her hand back. The bark is warm, almost feverish.\n\nA vendor nearby laughs. “First time seeing a ghost in the green?” He nods at the tree. “They remember everything. Even what we’d rather forget.”\n\nLina’s stomach twists. The city sells this as progress—sustainable, organic, inevitable. But the trees don’t just store data; they hoard history, raw and unfiltered. Who decides what’s erased? What’s preserved? The gingko’s leaves rustle, as if laughing with the wind. She steps back, suddenly aware of how many eyes—human and otherwise—are watching.",

She’d come out to rescue a drooping basil pot, and that’s when she heard it—not a voice, not words exactly, but a chorus of clear, patient impressions.\n\n*Drink. Cooler now. Safe.*\n\nMara froze, hand hovering above the soil. The basil’s thoughts were simple as breath. Below, the street trees unfurled quieter messages: *Weight of water. Slow joy. Remember light.*\n\nShe laughed once, sharp with disbelief, and the spider plant on her kitchen sill replied with a startled pulse: *Movement. Warm mammal. Curious.*\n\nThe rain thickened. Every leaf became a mind.\n\nMara spent the storm walking room to room, listening. The fern missed the window. The aloe remembered drought like a scar. The dying bouquet on her table clung to a fading: *Hold. Hold.*\n\nWhen the clouds finally broke, the world went mute again. Only dripping gutters spoke.\n\nThe next day she watched the forecast like a secret calendar. When rain returned, Mara carried her plants closer, opened the windows wide, and whispered back with her hands: water, shade, sun.\n\nThe plants didn’t thank her.\n\nThey simply thought: *Better.*",

They weren't voices so much as textures—warm, root-deep memories and quick, bright curiosities. Listening, she learned which flowers were lonely, which roots were sick, which seeds were dreaming of flight.\n\nRain became her translation hour. She watered a wilting fern and, days later, found it laughing anew. She forgave a neighbor after a willow whispered its story of loss. The city, soaked, revealed itself as a communal mind. When the clouds left, the voices folded inward like closed flowers, and she waited—hungry, patient—for the next rain to speak.",

Canada and the UK formed an Economic and Trade Working Group to improve market access, digital trade, and collaboration on AI and critical minerals.\n\nG7 leaders issued a joint statement on the Middle East, affirming Israel's right to defend itself, reiterating support for Israel's security, and declaring that \"Iran is the principal source of regional instability and terror.\"\n\nNotably, there was no final communiqué or official joint declaration on Ukraine. However, Prime Minister Carney issued a chair's summary noting G7 leaders expressed support for President Trump's efforts to achieve peace in Ukraine.\n\nThe summit was overshadowed by the Israel-Iran conflict, US-G7 trade tensions, and Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine. Leaders could not agree on a joint statement on the Ukraine War due to US resistance.\n\nCanada announced new support for Ukraine worth CA$4.3 billion along with additional sanctions on Russia.",

Alice is female (Alice is traditionally a female name, and the problem structure implies this).\n\n4.

The 122-point declaration urged greater global action on issues affecting developing nations, specifically addressing climate-related disasters and sovereign debt levels. The host nation emphasized a focus on climate change and confronting global inequality, which met resistance from the U.S..\n\nA significant controversy surrounding the summit was the U.S. boycott, ordered by President Donald Trump due to claims about South Africa's policies and its G20 agenda. The U.S. had also pressured South Africa not to adopt a leaders' declaration in its absence, but the declaration was ultimately adopted unanimously by the other members. The declaration also discussed ambitious targets for boosting renewable energy and addressing the debt service burden of developing nations.",

This was seen as a diplomatic win for the host, India.\n*   **Economic Issues:** Members committed to accelerating progress on the Sustainable Development Goals and reforming Multilateral Development Banks.\n*   **Climate & Energy:** There was an agreement to pursue tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030, though the phase-down of fossil fuels was not explicitly endorsed.\n*   **New Members:** The group formally admitted the African Union as a permanent member.\n\n**Key Controversies:**\nThe most significant controversy was the softened language on the war in Ukraine, which was a compromise to secure a unanimous declaration. Western nations accepted weaker phrasing than the previous year's direct condemnation of Russia. The final text also dropped references to \"Russian aggression\" seen in earlier drafts, reflecting divisions within the bloc.

The summit launched the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) as a counter to China’s Belt & Road, though details remain vague.
