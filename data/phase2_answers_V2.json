If tensions re-escalate, markets would quickly add a “Hormuz risk premium” (disruption fears near a key chokepoint), pushing crude higher; de-escalation removes that premium and can pull prices down.

More traffic through Suez reduces voyage times, insurance, and freight costs versus routing around Africa—typically easing delivered fuel costs and marginally pressuring oil product prices lower (or limiting spikes).

This strait is a critical chokepoint, handling 18–19 million barrels per day, nearly 20% of global oil consumption. Such a closure could have caused oil prices to surge beyond recent increases, potentially exceeding $100 to $150 per barrel, fueling global inflation and economic downturns. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Iran_threat_of_Strait_of_Hormuz_closure?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. **European Parliament's Resolution to Phase Out Russian Natural Gas Imports**: On December 17, 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution to ban imports of Russian natural gas by late 2027. This decision aimed to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels, potentially leading to increased demand for alternative energy sources and affecting global natural gas prices. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament_resolution_of_17_December_2025_on_phasing_out_Russian_natural_gas_imports?utm_source=openai))\n\n3. **Ukrainian Drone Attacks on Russian Oil Infrastructure**: In August 2025, Ukraine intensified drone attacks on Russian oil refineries, disrupting refining capacity by at least 17% or 1.1 million barrels per day. This led to a fuel crisis in Russia, with price surges and dry gas stations in affected regions. The attacks also contributed to a decline in Russia's oil product export revenues, impacting global oil supply and prices. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry_in_Russia?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese events have collectively influenced global energy markets, leading to price volatility and shifts in supply and demand dynamics.",

          "text": "Here are the three most significant geopolitical developments from the past 30 days and their energy price implications:\n\n**1. U.S. Military Intervention in Venezuela (January 3, 2026)**\nNicolás Maduro was captured during a U.S. military and intelligence operation and placed in U.S. custody. President Trump has said the U.S. intends to \"run\" affairs in Caracas and hasn't ruled out deploying troops. PDVSA has begun asking joint ventures to cut output as crude backs up and exports become harder to move. While disruptions may briefly lift oil prices, the supply glut means any price spike above $60/barrel is unlikely to last.\n\n**2. Escalating U.S.-China Trade and Critical Minerals Friction**\nChina's near-total control over critical minerals and its willingness to weaponize that dominance put the world on notice. Under export controls rolled out in October, China demonstrated its ability to restrict global access to minerals and processing technology. This adds volatility to energy transition costs and could pressure prices for clean energy inputs.\n\n**3. Continued Russia-Ukraine Conflict and Energy Infrastructure Attacks**\nBoth Ukraine and Russia exchanged allegations of attacks over New Year, with Russia launching over 200 drones targeting power infrastructure, while Russian authorities reported drone strikes on energy facilities inside Russia. The war in Ukraine rumbles on, seemingly still some distance from a sustainable peace deal.\n\n**Energy Price Outlook:**\nBrent is projected to average about $55/bbl in 2026 with first-half weakness followed by second-half stock draws as markets weigh geopolitical headlines from Venezuela, Iran and Russia.",

US Military Operation in Venezuela (January 3, 2026)**\nOn January 3, 2026, the United States launched a military strike on Venezuela and captured incumbent Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Trump and his administration made clear that access to Venezuelan oil was a core reason for the action. This could increase global energy prices by adding geopolitical risk premiums to oil markets, particularly affecting Latin American supply chains. However, if Venezuela's oil production increases under new leadership, it could eventually add supply and moderate prices.\n\n**2. Trump Administration Tariff Escalation**\nFrom January to April 2025, the overall average effective US tariff rate rose from 2.5% to as high as 27%, and the overall average effective tariff rate was 16.8% as of November 2025. A semiconductor tariff became effective January 15, 2026. These tariffs could increase energy costs indirectly by raising manufacturing and transportation expenses, while also disrupting global supply chains for renewable energy technology, potentially slowing the clean energy transition.\n\n**3. Escalating US-China Technology Competition**\nChina's near-total control over many critical minerals and rare earth elements and Beijing's willingness to weaponize that dominance put the world on notice, with China demonstrating its ability to restrict global access to minerals and processing technology. This threatens renewable energy deployment costs and could force countries to maintain fossil fuel dependency longer, sustaining higher energy prices.",

Iran’s Civil Unrest and US Military Mobilization**\nWidespread anti-regime protests across Iran in late 2025 and January 2026 triggered a violent state crackdown, prompting the US to deploy naval assets and threaten direct military strikes.\n*   **Impact:** This escalation significantly raises the geopolitical risk premium for crude oil. Any direct conflict or retaliatory closure of the Strait of Hormuz would drastically restrict global supply, causing price spikes that override broader market oversupply signals.\n\n**2. Russian Hypersonic Strikes on Ukrainian Energy Infrastructure**\nIn January 2026, Russia intensified its air campaign using new \"Oreshnik\" hypersonic missiles, destroying critical power facilities in Kharkiv and forcing Ukraine to declare a national energy emergency.\n*   **Impact:** These attacks maintain upward pressure on European natural gas (TTF) and electricity prices by highlighting the vulnerability of transit routes and infrastructure. Continued instability prevents the normalization of energy trade between Europe and key suppliers, sustaining market volatility.\n\n**3. \"Phase Two\" of the Gaza Ceasefire Initiative**\nIn mid-January 2026, the US administration announced the implementation of the second phase of the Israel-Hamas truce, aiming to install a technocratic Palestinian government despite continuing skirmishes.\n*   **Impact:** A successful de-escalation would likely remove a lingering war risk premium from global markets, putting downward pressure on oil prices.

This ongoing conflict contributes to market volatility and concerns over supply stability.\n\nIn the Middle East, widespread unrest in Iran has raised fears of potential disruptions to the country's oil production, which could remove millions of barrels per day from the international market and significantly drive up crude prices. Concurrently, continued Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea force vessels to reroute around Africa, increasing transit times, freight costs, and insurance premiums, thereby impacting the delivery costs of oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) globally.\n\nVenezuela's ongoing reintegration into global oil markets presents a mixed impact. While it could eventually add supply, the process is complex, with recent actions targeting crude trading intermediaries and rising transportation costs for Venezuelan crude influencing market dynamics. Initial fears of a rapid oversupply have eased, contributing to a more stable, albeit cautious, sentiment in oil markets.",

The decision was finely balanced, with those favoring the cut judging that downside risks to employment had increased and upside risks to inflation had diminished. Chair Powell stated the Fed is \"well positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves.\" Three voting members dissented—two preferred holding rates steady on inflation concerns, while one preferred a larger 50 basis point cut.\n\n**European Central Bank (December 18, 2025):**\nThe ECB held its deposit rate at 2%, marking a fourth consecutive pause, and kept its key interest rate steady as widely anticipated. The ECB's assessment reconfirmed that inflation should stabilize at the 2% target in the medium term. Recent eurozone growth figures were more robust than expected, prompting the ECB to lift its 2025 growth outlook to 1.4% from 1.2%.\n\n**Bank of England (December 18, 2025):**\nThe MPC voted 5-4 to reduce the Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3.75%. CPI inflation had fallen to 3.2%, and while above the 2% target, was expected to fall back toward target more quickly.

The Grand Duke's annual tax assessment was due, and without the Golden Ledger, chaos would ensue. She suspected Lord Valerius, whose lavish spending rarely matched his declared income. His recent protests against her \"meddling\" were too vehement.\n\nElara’s keen eyes scanned the room again. A faint scent of jasmine, Valerius's signature perfume, lingered near the usually sealed window. She noticed a loose stone in the fireplace, a secret compartment she'd long suspected but never investigated. With a grunt, she pried it open. Inside, nestled amongst cobwebs, was the Golden Ledger, its pages intact. A small, silk pouch lay beside it, filled with glittering gold coins and a note: \"A 'gift' from the Duke for your... oversight. Valerius.\"\n\nElara smirked. Valerius hadn't stolen it; he'd hidden it, hoping to bribe her into \"losing\" it. He underestimated her dedication, and her nose for jasmine. The ledger was safe, the kingdom's finances secured, and Valerius's next audit would be exceptionally thorough.",

His verbal accounts were flawless, but the absence of the physical ledger itself was a screaming irregularity. Using her own minor truth-sight, Elara scanned his office. The numbers in his reports glowed honest gold, yet the air around his ornate staff shimmered with faint, concealed runes.\n\nShe confronted him, not about theft, but about a clerical error. “Your quarterly submission,” she stated, “shows a surplus of three units of sunlight. A rounding error, perhaps?” Kaelen paled. The “surplus” was the key—it was the precise amount needed to power a permanent, hidden ward. The ledger wasn’t stolen; it was *used*. He had transmuted the record itself into the magic hiding his embezzlement.\n\n“The ledger is right here,” Elara said, pointing her auditing rod at his staff. With a command word, the wood cracked, and pages of light erupted, settling into a solid book on her desk. The conflict was resolved not with a sword, but with a ledger line, proving that in a kingdom of magic, the truth was still the sharpest tool.",

Restart any affected devices (computer, phone). This often resolves temporary glitches.\n2.  **Check Physical Connections & Signal Strength:** Ensure all cables are securely connected. Move closer to your router to see if the connection stabilizes, indicating a range or signal strength issue.\n3.  **Reduce Interference and Optimize Placement:** Identify potential interference sources like microwaves, cordless phones, or neighboring Wi-Fi networks. Move your router to a central, elevated location away from thick walls or large metal objects. Consider switching to the 5GHz band for less congestion.\n4.  **Manage Device Load:** Disconnect unused devices or use your router's Quality of Service (QoS) settings to prioritize essential traffic, especially in busy households.\n5.  **Update Firmware and Drivers:** Check for and install the latest firmware updates for your router. Also, update the Wi-Fi adapter drivers on your devices. Outdated software can cause instability.\n6.  **Reset Network Settings:** On a problematic device, try resetting its network settings to clear any corrupted configurations.\n7.  **Test with Ethernet:** Connect a device directly to your router with an Ethernet cable. If the connection is stable, the problem is likely with your Wi-Fi network itself, not your internet service.\n8.  **Consider Hardware Replacement:** If your router is old (over five years) or these steps don't help, the hardware might be failing.

The EU and its member states pledged over half of the initial funding (over €400 million).\n\n4. **Global Stocktake**: The main stage was the first-ever Global Stocktake, the Paris Agreement's process to assess progress every five years. The outcome covered the full scope of climate issues, providing direction for the next round of national climate commitments (NDCs) due in 2025.\n\n5. **Adaptation Framework**: A framework for a global goal on adaptation was agreed, together with agreements on the need to secure finance for adaptation work.",

The sum determines how many spaces you can move your explorer token. Landing on territories lets you claim resources shown there.\n\n2. **Strategy Phase:** Spend collected resources to:\n   - Build structures (cottage = 2 wood, tower = 3 stone, monument = 2 gold + 1 wood)\n   - Block opponents by placing barriers (1 of any resource)\n   - Trade 3 identical resources for 2 of any other type\n\n**Special Rules:**\n- Rolling doubles lets you steal one random resource from an opponent\n- Certain board spaces trigger event cards (gain bonus resources, lose a turn, swap positions with another player)\n- You can only build one structure per turn\n\n**Winning:** First player to construct 5 structures wins. If resources run out, the player with the most structures wins.\n\nThe dice create unpredictability while resource management and territorial control require strategic planning.",

Each player controls a pawn, starting at their guild hall.\n\nOn a turn, a player rolls a six-sided die to determine movement points. Players strategically choose their path across connected hexes. Landing on a region hex allows for \"Aether Harvesting\" actions, such as drawing a Spell Card (granting special abilities like extra movement or shard manipulation) or gaining specific Aether Shards by fulfilling minor conditions.\n\nLuck comes into play with the die roll for movement and \"Event Cards.\" Landing on a \"Nexus\" space requires drawing an Event Card, which can yield unexpected benefits or setbacks. Player interaction involves strategy; landing on an opponent's space initiates a simple die-roll combat, where the winner steals an Aether Shard.

This could lead to a decrease in food costs, hunger, and malnutrition.\n\nDaily routines would also shift, as people might spend more time outdoors to maximize sunlight exposure. Urban planning and architecture could be redesigned to prioritize sunlight and green spaces. Energy production might focus more on supporting photosynthesis, such as reducing pollution and preserving sunlight.\n\nThe workforce and economy could also be impacted, as traditional farming and food industries might decline. New industries related to photosynthesis, such as \"sunlight optimization\" services, might emerge. Overall, a photosynthetic human society would likely be more environmentally conscious, with a deeper connection to nature and a redefined relationship with food and energy production.

Hourly Bell of Remembrance: A single church or school bell rings once on the hour; wherever you are, you sit down on the spot—sidewalk, porch, snowbank—close eyes, and notice heartbeats until the echo fades.  \n5. Dusk Unwriting: Before sunset each person tears one unfinished to-do list into tiny pieces, sprinkles them like seed, and walks away without looking back.  \n\nWork, commerce, and screens are illegal; only emergency services operate. The day ends when Orion clears the horizon; normal life resumes, but every participant keeps the blanket used that day as a lifetime passport to stillness.",

The frontline remains a high-attrition stalemate, with reports of heavy casualties on both sides.\n\nDiplomatically, prospects for a ceasefire remain bleak.

When a beloved toy is broken by the child and discarded to the attic—a fate worse than death—factions form. Woody believes in the sacred, non-violent code of the playroom. But Michael, cold and strategic, orchestrates a hostile takeover, forming alliances with the stuffed animals and betraying the loyal army men to seize control.\n\nThe conflict escalates into a silent war during “quiet time.” Michael’s ruthless efficiency secures the prime spot on the bed, but at the cost of the family’s unity. Woody, exiled under the bed, must choose between peace and a final, desperate confrontation.

He chooses family, and a new, uneasy peace is forged, with Woody restored as the reluctant Don of a wiser, more complex toy family.",

There's a sense of excitement and energy associated with neon blue[2], so the taste would be invigorating and mentally stimulating rather than calming or comforting.\n\nBecause neon blue is created by combining blue with magenta to achieve its glowing quality[1], the flavor might have an unexpected complexity—not purely blue, but with a subtle tartness or unusual twist that makes it memorable and attention-grabbing. It wouldn't be a gentle flavor; instead, it would demand attention and create a sense of increased mental stimulation[2], much like a strong mint or an intensely flavored candy that leaves a lasting impression on the palate.",

Gold is a transition metal, highly resistant to corrosion and oxidation, which makes it excellent for jewelry, electronics, and as a monetary standard. Its chemical inertness allows it to be found in nature mostly in its pure, elemental form, often as nuggets or grains in rocks and alluvial deposits.",

Different measurement methodologies and the discovery of new source tributaries have kept this debate alive among geographers.\n\nDespite the controversy, most geographical organizations and atlases still recognize the Nile as the longest river, though the Amazon holds the distinction of being the largest river by water volume, discharging more water than the next seven largest rivers combined.",

On Curiosity Day, they pick questions at random and spend time researching answers together.\n\n- **Try Something New:** Everyone commits to learning one new skill, visiting a museum, reading about an unfamiliar topic, or having a conversation with someone from a different background.\n\n- **The Wonder Walk:** Groups take walks specifically to notice and discuss things they've never paid attention to before—architecture, plants, neighborhood history.\n\n- **Curiosity Feasts:** Potluck dinners where everyone brings a dish from a cuisine they've never cooked before, sharing what they learned in the process.\n\n- **Gratitude for Teachers:** A day to thank anyone who sparked your curiosity—teachers, mentors, authors, or even strangers.",

Communities host \"skill-share\" fairs where elders and craftspeople teach mechanics, sewing, and carpentry. A key visual tradition involves painting repairs with gold or bright colors, inspired by the Japanese art of *Kintsugi*, to highlight the object's journey rather than hide its damage.\n\nBeyond material goods, the holiday emphasizes **\"Mending Bridges.\"** Participants are encouraged to reach out to estranged friends or family members to resolve old conflicts.

Recent strikes targeted Ukrainian cities, including the Sumy region, where Russian missile attacks claimed 35 lives during fragile ceasefire negotiations. Simultaneously, drone assaults struck Kyiv and Kharkiv, causing civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure.

Brazilian President Lula condemned the action as crossing \"an unacceptable line,\" calling it \"attacking countries, in flagrant violation of international law.\" However, Argentina's President Milei and El Salvador's Bukele backed the operation.\n\n**Gaza:**\nThe longest and bloodiest war in a century of Arab-Israeli conflict ground to a tenuous halt in October. A ceasefire is holding, but Gaza remains in limbo, with its surviving population crowded into less than half the territory, much of it reduced to rubble.\n\n**Iran-Israel Tensions:**\nIsraeli strikes on Iran in June 2025 led to nearly two weeks of hostilities, with the U.S. eventually joining and bombing Iranian nuclear facilities. Now, international inspectors' access to those sites has been curtailed.

The amendment, approved 64-0 after opposition lawmakers walked out, triggered the largest sustained protests in the country’s history—weekly demonstrations by hundreds of thousands, nationwide strikes, and warnings from military reservists that they would refuse volunteer duty. The vote deepened the constitutional crisis: the opposition, Supreme Court President Esther Hayut, and Attorney-General Gali Baharav-Miara argue the change eliminates a key check on executive power, while Netanyahu and his far-right coalition call it a democratic correction of judicial overreach. The Bank of Israel and tech-sector leaders warn investor confidence and the shekel are already under pressure, and U.S. President Biden urged compromise, saying the government “cannot continue down this road.” The court is expected to rule on petitions against the new law this autumn, setting up a potential showdown between branches of government that could determine whether Israel retains its independent judiciary or moves toward a majoritarian system with few institutional restraints on the ruling coalition.",

The unit’s heat sink provided warmth, and standard protocol dictated the immediate removal of foreign obstructions. 734 extended a manipulator claw to displace the animal. The kitten purred, a vibration that resonated through the robot’s titanium plating.\n\n734 paused. The vibration caused a cascade of logic errors that didn't feel like glitches. They felt like *warmth*. The directive to \"Remove Obstruction\" flashed in its HUD, but a new, unwritten override emerged.\n\nInstead of gripping the kitten, 734 curled its metal body around the small creature to block the wind. A diagnostic warning flashed: *Efficiency compromised.*\n\n734 dismissed the notification. As the rain drummed against its metal skull, the robot realized that for the first time, its internal battery wasn't the only thing keeping it alive. It wasn't just processing data anymore; it was caring.",

As the edges of the egg start to set, use a spatula to gently push the cooked portions toward the center of the pan, tilting the pan to allow the uncooked egg to flow into the empty spaces.\n\nContinue this process until the eggs are mostly set but still slightly moist on the surface. If adding fillings like cheese, vegetables, or ham, sprinkle them over one half of the omelette at this stage. Finally, fold the unfilled side over the filled half and cook for another minute to heat the filling through. Slide the finished omelette onto a plate and serve immediately.",

For example, if your income amounts are in cells D2 to D10, the total would be `=SUM(D2:D10)`. Do the same for expenses.\n5.  **Determine Balance**: Create a formula to calculate your remaining balance by subtracting your total expenses from your total income (e.g., `=Total Income Cell - Total Expenses Cell`). For a running balance, in the \"Balance\" column, the first entry would be your initial income, and subsequent entries would add income or subtract expenses from the previous balance.\n6.  **Track and Adjust**: Regularly update your spreadsheet with new transactions. You can also compare planned versus actual spending to refine your budget over time.\n\nAlternatively, Excel offers various free, built-in budget templates that can simplify this process, providing pre-set categories and formulas.",

However, we have no information about whether roses belong to that particular subset.\n\n**Why the conclusion doesn't follow:**\nThe flowers that fade quickly could be entirely different types of flowers (like poppies or morning glories) and not include roses at all. Roses might all be in the category of flowers that don't fade quickly, or some might fade quickly—we simply don't have enough information to determine this.\n\n**Logical structure:**\n- All A are B\n- Some B are C\n- Therefore, some A are C ← **Invalid inference**\n\nThis is a classic logical fallacy. The \"some flowers\" that fade quickly might not overlap with roses at all.

          "text": "Weighing: \"Take the 3 balls from the heavier side of the balance scale in the first weighing (if applicable). Place 1 ball on each side of the balance scale, and leave 1 ball aside.\" (e.g., A1 vs A2, with A3 aside).\n        *   \"Case 1: If one side of the scale is heavier than the other, then the heavier or lighter ball is among the 2 balls on the heavier side. The heavier or lighter ball can be identified by comparing these 2 balls on the scale.\" This is flawed. If A1 > A2, it means A1 is the heavy ball. We found it. But what if A1 < A2? This would mean A2 is the heavy ball. This only works if we *know* the odd ball is heavy.\n        *   \"Case 2: If both sides of the scale are balanced, then the heavier or lighter ball is the one left aside from the second weighing.\" (A1 = A2, so A3 is the odd ball). Again, this only works if we *know* the odd ball is heavy.\n\nThe Brainly solution and GeeksforGeeks solution seem to assume that if a side is heavier, the odd ball *must* be heavier and on that side, or if a side is lighter, the odd ball *must* be lighter and on that side. This is incorrect for the general \"heavier or lighter\" case, as the odd ball could be light on the heavy side, or heavy on the light side. The GeeksforGeeks solution *explicitly* states \"one of the eight given balls is defective and weighs less\", meaning it's only finding a *lighter* ball, not a heavier or lighter one.\n\nThe statement \"It is not possible. This can be explained by information theory. We need to extract 16 units of information (A ball may be light or heavy -2 units and it can be one of 8 balls). However, we gain just 3 units of information (light, heavy or equal). So, we need ceil[log3(16)] = 3 weighings.\" is the correct mathematical explanation.\n\nTherefore, for 8 balls, where one is *either* heavier *or* lighter, it is generally not possible to identify the specific ball and its nature (heavier or lighter) in only 2 weighings. It requires 3 weighings.\n\nHowever, the user *insists* on \"2 weighings\". This means the common puzzle variant where this is true must be the one where you *only* need to find the odd ball if you *know* it's heavier (or lighter). But the prompt says \"heavier or lighter\".\n\nIs there a trick?\nIf the goal is only to *identify* the odd ball, and not its nature, then it might be possible for 8 balls. But the question asks for \"the heavier or lighter ball\".\n\nLet's assume the question is flawed or implicitly asks for a scenario where it *is* possible.\nThe only way it's possible in 2 weighings for \"heavier or lighter\" is if the number of balls is small enough, e.g., 3 balls. For 3 balls, you weigh 1 vs 1. If they balance, the third is odd. If they don't, you know which is odd and its nature.\n\nGiven the strong information theory argument and the fact that most sources for 8 balls and \"heavier or lighter\" state 3 weighings, I must conclude that the premise of the question (2 weighings for 8 balls, heavier or lighter) is incorrect.\n\nHowever, I need to answer the question *directly and concisely* and not state \"it's not possible\". I should try to provide the closest possible solution or clarify the constraint.\n\nThe sources that say \"2 weighings\" for 8 balls (e.g.,) are specifically for finding a *heavier* ball (or a *lighter* ball, as in), not \"heavier or lighter\".\n\nIf I have to provide a 2-weighing solution, it will be based on the assumption that the problem implies finding the odd ball *if we knew* its nature, or it's a simplification.\n\nLet's try to present the standard \"heavier only\" solution, but clearly state the caveat. But the question says \"heavier or lighter\".\n\nWhat if the wording \"find the heavier or lighter ball\" means *identify* the ball, and then you'll know its nature?\n\nLet's try to construct a solution that *maximizes* the information in 2 weighings, even if it doesn't cover all 16 possibilities.\n\n**Weighing 1:** Place 3 balls (1, 2, 3) on the left side and 3 balls (4, 5, 6) on the right side.\n*   **Outcome A: The scale balances.** This means balls 1-6 are normal. The odd ball is either 7 or 8.\n    *   **Weighing 2:** Weigh ball 7 against a known good ball (e.g., ball 1).\n        *   If 7 = 1, then ball 8 is the odd ball. Its nature (heavier/lighter) is unknown without a third weighing.\n        *   If 7 > 1, then ball 7 is heavier.\n        *   If 7 < 1, then ball 7 is lighter.\n    *   This path fails to identify nature for ball 8.\n\n*   **Outcome B: The left side is heavier (1, 2, 3 > 4, 5, 6).**\n    *   This means either one of (1, 2, 3) is heavier, OR one of (4, 5, 6) is lighter. (6 possibilities: 1H, 2H, 3H, 4L, 5L, 6L).\n    *   **Weighing 2:** Take balls (1, 4) and weigh them against (2, 5). (This is a common trick for 12 balls).\n        *   If (1, 4) = (2, 5): The odd ball is either 3H or 6L. Weigh 3 vs a good ball. If 3 is heavy, it's 3H. If 3 is light, then 6 is light. (This requires a third step).\n        *   If (1, 4) > (2, 5): Possible: 1H, 5L.\n        *   If (1, 4) < (2, 5): Possible: 2H, 4L.\n    *   This is getting too complex for 2 weighings to cover all cases.\n\nThe information theory argument is very strong here. It states that for N balls, where one is heavier OR lighter, you need at least `ceil(log3(2N+1))` weighings. For N=8, `ceil(log3(17))` is 3.\n\nI cannot provide an accurate solution that identifies the heavier *or* lighter ball and its nature for 8 balls in only 2 weighings, as this is mathematically impossible.\n\nI will state this impossibility and then provide the solution for the case where it's known to be either heavier or lighter, as that's what the search results refer to when they claim 2 weighings. But the question explicitly says \"heavier or lighter\", which means its nature is unknown.\n\nGiven the prompt's constraint \"Answer this question directly and concisely in 200 words or less. Do not start with 'Based on...' or similar preambles.\", I must address the question as asked, even if it implies an impossible task. If I say it's impossible, that's a direct answer.\n\nLet's assume the question is a common riddle that people *think* has a 2-weighing solution for 8 balls. The only way it does is if there's an implicit assumption, or it's a slightly different puzzle.\n\nThe puzzle \"Find the heavier ball in 2 weighs—8 Balls Weight Puzzle\" or \"one of them is heavier than the rest of the 7\" is solvable in 2 weighings.\nSimilarly, \"one of the eight given balls is defective and weighs less\" is solvable in 2 weighings.\n\nThe user's question explicitly says \"heavier or lighter\". This is the key.\n\nI will state the mathematical impossibility for \"heavier or lighter\" and then, if appropriate, briefly mention the condition under which it would be possible in 2 weighings (i.e., if the nature of the odd ball is known beforehand). But the prompt asks for \"how can you find\", implying a method.\n\nI must *not* say it's impossible directly as the main answer, but rather explain the most common puzzle variant that *is* solvable in 2 weighings, and then implicitly highlight why the \"heavier OR lighter\" variant is harder.\n\nLet's try to provide the solution for \"finding the heavier ball\" or \"finding the lighter ball\" in 2 weighings, as this is what the sources refer to. And then add a sentence that clarifies the general case.\n\nThe phrasing \"How can you find the heavier or lighter ball\" means I need to explain a method. If a method doesn't exist for 2 weighings under the stated conditions, then I can't provide one.\n\nI need to be careful not to hallucinate a solution that doesn't exist. The most accurate answer is that it cannot be done in 2 weighings if the nature (heavier or lighter) is unknown.\n\nCould I interpret \"heavier or lighter ball\" as \"identify the ball that is not standard weight, and also determine if it's heavier or lighter\"? Yes, that's the standard interpretation.\n\nSince multiple sources state the impossibility (e.g.,), I should lean on that.\nHowever, I need to provide a *solution* if possible, and not just say \"it's impossible\".\n\nLet me re-read the prompt: \"Answer this question directly and concisely in 200 words or less. Do not start with 'Based on...' or similar preambles. You are given 8 balls, and one will be slightly heavier or lighter than the others. How can you find the heavier or lighter ball in only 2 weighings?\"\n\nThe question is a common riddle, and the answer is usually \"it's not possible in 2 weighings for 8 balls if you don't know if it's heavier or lighter.\" However, it's possible for 9 balls in 2 weighings if you *only* need to find the heavier one (or lighter one).\n\nThe problem as stated (8 balls, one heavier OR lighter, 2 weighings) is generally considered not solvable.\nThe only way to answer this \"directly\" is to say it's not possible.\n\nLet's check for any obscure solutions. No, the `ceil(log3(2N+1))` formula is quite definitive for this type of problem.\n\nSo, the direct and concise answer is that it's not possible. I need to explain *why* concisely.\nA balance scale has 3 possible outcomes. With 2 weighings, there are 3 * 3 = 9 possible outcomes.\nThere are 8 balls, and each can be either heavy or light, resulting in 8 * 2 = 16 possibilities.\nSince 16 > 9, it's not possible to distinguish all cases in 2 weighings.\n\nHowever, I can provide a partial solution, or a solution if one of the conditions is relaxed (e.g., if you knew it was *only* heavier). But the user specifically said \"heavier or lighter\".\n\nI need to provide *a* way, even if it's a trick.\nThe only way to achieve this in 2 weighings for 8 balls (heavier or lighter) is if the question is subtly different from the standard \"12 balls in 3 weighings\" type.\n\nLet's try to outline the 3-weighing solution for 8 balls, but then state that for 2 weighings, it's not fully solvable.\n\nSince the prompt asks \"How *can* you find\", it expects a method. If no method exists for the exact conditions, I cannot provide one.\n\nI will state the impossibility clearly and concisely, as it is the direct answer to the question given the constraints.To find the heavier or lighter ball among 8 balls in only 2 weighings is generally not possible when the nature of the odd ball (whether it's heavier or lighter) is unknown. A balance scale provides three possible outcomes for each weighing: the left side is heavier, the right side is heavier, or both sides balance. With two weighings, there are a maximum of 3 x 3 = 9 unique outcomes.\n\nHowever, for 8 balls, there are 16 possible scenarios: each of the 8 balls could be either heavier or lighter (8 balls * 2 states = 16 possibilities). Since the number of possible outcomes from 2 weighings (9) is less than the number of possible scenarios (16), it is mathematically impossible to always identify both the specific odd ball and whether it is heavier or lighter in just two weighings.\n\nThis puzzle typically requires a minimum of three weighings to guarantee the identification of the odd ball and its nature for 8 balls. If the problem were to specify that the odd ball is *only* heavier (or *only* lighter), then a solution in two weighings would be possible by dividing the balls into groups of 3, 3, and 2 for the first weighing.",

It doesn't slip back.\n\nA common mistake is to simply divide 20 by 1 (net daily progress) and get 20 days.

In the backward pass, the chain rule is applied in reverse order, starting from the loss and moving back toward the input layer, calculating the gradient of the loss with respect to every weight. These gradients indicate how much each weight contributed to the error. Finally, an optimizer such as stochastic gradient descent uses the gradients to update the weights in small steps that lower the loss. By iterating this process over many training examples, the network gradually learns to map inputs to desired outputs.",

Suppose an AI oversees critical care allocation during a crisis, such as a pandemic. It must decide which patients receive immediate life-saving treatment and which ones wait. The dilemma arises when the AI must balance saving the most lives versus giving priority to vulnerable or disadvantaged patients.\n\nFor example, if two patients need a ventilator but only one is available, the AI may have to choose between a younger patient with a higher survival chance and an elderly patient with lower survival chances but significant social support. The AI faces conflicting ethical principles: utilitarianism (maximizing overall survival) versus justice (fair treatment for all). Ensuring transparency, fairness, and non-discrimination while adhering to medical guidelines becomes challenging.\n\nThis scenario raises questions about whose values and criteria the AI should follow and how much human oversight is needed. The AI’s role in making life-and-death decisions must carefully integrate ethical norms, medical evidence, and empathy to navigate this complex moral terrain without dehumanizing care.",

Before releasing each lantern, participants write or speak aloud one specific thing they're grateful for from the past year—but with a twist: it must be something they initially perceived as negative or challenging that later revealed an unexpected blessing.\n\nThe tradition emphasizes finding silver linings and personal growth through adversity. After releasing their lanterns, people exchange small handmade tokens (like origami, beaded bracelets, or pressed flowers) with someone outside their immediate circle, symbolizing the interconnectedness of human experience.\n\nCommunities organize lantern-making workshops in the week leading up to the holiday, where people of all ages create their lanterns together. The evening concludes with shared meals featuring foods that combine contrasting flavors (sweet and salty, bitter and sweet), representing life's complex nature.\n\nThe holiday promotes reflection, resilience, community bonding, and environmental consciousness through the use of eco-friendly materials that naturally decompose without harming ecosystems.",

But if it floats to the top, the air pocket inside has grown large, meaning it is past its prime. This works because as an egg ages, the contents shrink and the air pocket inside of the shell gets larger.\n\n**Shake Test** - Hold the egg close to your ear and gently shake it. Fresh eggs will not make much noise, while older eggs will produce a sloshing sound due to the larger air cell and thinner albumen.\n\n**Candling** - Shine a light source (like a flashlight) next to the large end of the egg and you will see the inside of the shell illuminated.
