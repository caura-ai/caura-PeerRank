Key outcomes were:\n\n- **Middle East/Iran–Israel:** Leaders issued a joint statement backing Israel’s security and right to self-defence, calling Iran the main source of regional instability, insisting Iran must not obtain a nuclear weapon, urging broader de-escalation (including a Gaza ceasefire), and pledging coordination to stabilize energy markets. ([g7.utoronto.ca](https://www.g7.utoronto.ca/summit/2025kananaskis/250616-iran.html?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Ukraine/Russia:** The summit **did not produce a unified G7 statement on Ukraine**; instead, support and pressure on Russia advanced mainly through national actions and smaller group alignment. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/6c86a0a8463603c9b1a3e950382af0a2?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Economic security:** Leaders discussed supply-chain resilience and critical minerals and reiterated concern about non-market practices and overcapacity (widely framed around China). ([g7.utoronto.ca](https://www.g7.utoronto.ca/evaluations/2025kananaskis/goals-met.html?utm_source=openai))  \n\nHow commitments differed:\n\n- The **U.S. (Trump)** was pivotal in **blocking consensus on Ukraine** and **declined to join new Russia sanctions**, contributing to weaker collective outcomes. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/6c86a0a8463603c9b1a3e950382af0a2?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Canada** announced major **new Russia sanctions** plus additional military/financial support for Ukraine, moving ahead even without full G7 unity.

([g7.canada.ca](https://g7.canada.ca/en/))\n\nMembers differed in emphasis and willingness to commit collectively.

We reiterate our support for the security of Israel. Iran is the principal source of regional instability and terror.\"\n- Canada launched a new G7 Critical Minerals Production Alliance with international partners.\n\n**Divisions Among Members:**\n- The G7 could not agree on a joint statement on the Ukraine War due to US resistance—a stark contrast to previous years when the G7 coordinated sanctions against Russia.\n- No final G7 leaders' communiqué was adopted, contrary to previous summits.\n- The Canadian hosts opted not to try to reach agreement on a traditional communique, highlighting fractures among G7 members.\n- The summit was overshadowed by trade tensions between the US and other G7 nations, with the Trump administration's tariffs imposed on every G7 member.",

Six joint statements were issued covering critical mineral supply chains, AI adoption, quantum technology, wildfire prevention, and combating transnational repression. Canada launched the Critical Minerals Production Alliance to secure supply chains.\n\n**Major Divisions:**\n\nLeaders could not agree on a joint statement on Ukraine due to US resistance, contrasting sharply with previous years of coordinated sanctions against Russia. Trump administration tariffs imposed on all G7 members created trade tensions that dominated discussions. President Trump left early to address the Israel-Iran conflict.\n\nG7 leaders expressed support for Trump's peace efforts in Ukraine, though without formal consensus.

This lack of unity forced the Canadian host to abandon the traditional comprehensive communiqué in favor of a Chair's Summary and separate topic-specific statements.

A key agreement was the provision of approximately $50 billion in additional funding for Ukraine, financed by the income from frozen Russian state assets. Leaders also endorsed the U.S.-backed deal for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and a pathway to a two-state solution. The summit adopted a more assertive stance towards China, committing to counter its economic expansionism. Other outcomes included prioritizing energy cooperation with Africa through the \"Energy for Growth\" initiative, promoting safe Artificial Intelligence deployment, and reaffirming commitments to net-zero emissions by 2050 and conserving 30% of land and oceans by 2030.\n\nDifferences in member countries' commitments were evident in several areas. The European Union initially showed reluctance regarding the extensive use of frozen Russian assets for Ukraine, though an agreement was reached. On climate change, while targets were reaffirmed, the G7 communiqué did not commit to submitting new 2035 climate plans within the deadline, potentially affecting the EU's climate leadership. Italy's presidency shaped the agenda by emphasizing migration, Africa, and AI, differing from the previous Japanese presidency's focus on economic security and China. Furthermore, the communiqué omitted prior references to \"access to safe and legal abortion,\" marking a shift from previous statements.",

The group also reached a political deal to phase out coal-fired power plants by 2035, though flexibility was granted to major economies like Japan and Germany, which rely more heavily on coal and gas.\n\nKey differences emerged on other climate and financial commitments. France and others pushed for more ambitious language on ending fossil fuel subsidies, but faced resistance. On China, there was unity on concerns over industrial overcapacity but divergence on specific tariff actions, with the EU cautious compared to the US. Regarding abortion, the final communiqué reflected a compromise, mentioning \"full, equitable access to healthcare\" but omitting the specific term \"abortion\" after opposition from Italy and Japan, highlighting differing domestic political pressures.",

Additionally, the G7 countries had varying levels of commitment to providing financial support to Ukraine, with some countries pledging more substantial aid packages than others.

Wait, let me check that range again. The federal funds rate now sits in a range of 3.5% to 3.75% after the third consecutive 25-basis-point rate cut in December.\n\nTo justify this decision, officials who favored lowering the rate generally judged that downside risks to employment had increased in recent months and upside risks to inflation had diminished since earlier in 2025. They noted that reducing the policy rate would be consistent with the projected decline in inflation over coming quarters while contributing to a strengthening of economic activity in 2026 that would help stabilize labor market conditions after this year's cooling.\n\nThe Fed cited solid real GDP growth in the third quarter, though the median FOMC projection is for an inflation rate of 2.4% by the end of 2026, with growth in gross domestic product rising to 2.3%. However, the tenor of the FOMC's statement and remarks by Chair Jerome Powell after the December meeting substantially raised the bar for a rate cut in January.",

Like the absence of sunlight had learned a new trick.\n\nShe tried to name it the way you name ordinary things. Slate. Ink. Violet. None of them held. This color wasn’t on the bright side of anything. It didn’t live in paint chips or sunsets. It only surfaced where light gave up.\n\nAt home she drew a square on white paper and shaded it with a lamp. The shadow fell clean and gray—until she slid her finger into it. The new color bloomed around her skin, a thin halo, as if the shadow recognized her touch and answered in its own tongue.\n\nMara chased it through the city. Under bridges it pooled like quiet water. Between parked cars it flickered like a thought you almost remember. In the alley behind the library it clung to the bricks, patient and watchful.\n\nShe began carrying a small mirror, not to reflect the world, but to make shadows where she wanted them. In the curve of her palm, the color appeared again: soft, steady, impossibly calm. It felt like standing inside a secret.\n\nThat night, she turned off every lamp and sat by the window. Streetlight spilled in, carving the room into bright rectangles and dark corners. The new color gathered in the corners, richer with each passing car.\n\nMara understood then: it wasn’t a color missing from daylight. It was a color daylight couldn’t bear.\n\nShe leaned closer, and the shadows seemed to lean back. For a moment she saw the world as it looked when no one was watching—edges unguarded, truths unpolished, everything honest in its dim disguise.\n\nAnd when morning came, the color vanished without goodbye, leaving only ordinary darkness—like a door quietly closed.",

She had been looking for lost things—coins, names carved into concrete—but the shadow answered with a color she had no words for.\n\nIt was not black or blue but a thin presence at the edge of visibility, a hush that swallowed iridescence and left something entirely new: a soft, shifting hue that bloomed only where light refused to reach. When she lifted her hand into the dark, the color pooled along her fingers like ink filling a glass, then thinned and vanished the moment a shaft of sun crossed it.\n\nExcited, she drew with her fingertip on the shadowed wall; the mark held for a breath, luminous and impossible. She took the alley at midnight and watched the city wear it around its feet, a private garment stitched to every silhouette. On the train she taught herself to shade her own shadow until strangers leaned closer, puzzled and motionless.\n\nNo camera caught it. No lamp replicated it. Mara learned to give it names—first loss, then hush, then home—and understood that some discoveries live only where light yields. She became the keeper of that quiet color, tracing the world’s secret seams.",

Let me craft that for you:\n\n---\n\n# The Color in the Dark\n\nMaya first noticed it on a Tuesday, crouched beneath her grandmother's oak tree.\n\nThe shadow pooling around the roots wasn't quite black, wasn't quite purple. It was something else entirely—a color that had no name, that shouldn't exist.\n\nShe blinked. The color remained.\n\n\"Do you see that?\" she asked her brother, pointing.\n\n\"See what? It's just shade.\"\n\nBut it wasn't. Over the following days, Maya began cataloging her discovery. The color only appeared in shadows cast by living things—trees, animals, people. Never buildings. Never cars. And it shifted, deepened, breathed.\n\nShe tried to photograph it. The camera captured only ordinary darkness.\n\nShe tried to paint it. Every pigment looked wrong, dead on the canvas.\n\nHer art professor dismissed her descriptions as \"overactive pattern recognition.\" Her optometrist found nothing unusual about her eyes.\n\nBut Maya knew what she saw.\n\nOne evening, she sat in her own shadow, stretched long by the setting sun. The nameless color surrounded her like water. She reached down and, for just a moment, felt it—cool and electric against her fingertips.\n\n\"What are you?\" she whispered.\n\nThe shadow didn't answer. But it pulsed, just slightly, as if acknowledging her.\n\nMaya smiled. Some things weren't meant to be explained or shared. Some things existed only in the space between light and dark, visible only to those patient enough to look.\n\nShe named the color \"umbra\" in her private journal, though she knew even that word was insufficient.\n\nEvery day after, she spent an hour sitting with the shadows, learning their secret language of color. The world thought her strange. Maya didn't mind.\n\nShe had discovered something ancient and hidden, something that had always been there, waiting.\n\nAnd that was enough.\n\n---\n\n*Word count: 298*",

But it was in the dimness of her grandmother's attic that she saw it for the first time.\n\nShe'd been sorting through old canvases when the afternoon sun shifted, casting long shadows across the floorboards. There, in the darkest corner where two shadows overlapped, was a color she couldn't name. Not purple, not blue, not any shade she'd ever mixed on her palette. It shimmered like oil on water, but darker—impossibly darker—yet somehow radiant.\n\nMaya blinked. The color remained.\n\nShe moved closer, and it vanished. Stepped back, and there it was again, living only in the deepest shadows. Her heart raced. She grabbed her phone to photograph it, but the camera showed only ordinary darkness.\n\nOver the following weeks, Maya became obsessed. She learned to find it everywhere: beneath park benches at dusk, in the space between her fingers when she held them to lamplight, in the hollow of her collarbone in the bathroom mirror. The color existed in a spectrum invisible to direct light, revealed only by its absence.\n\nShe tried to paint it, mixing every pigment she owned, but nothing came close. The color had no business existing in brightness.\n\nOne evening, her partner found her sitting in the dark.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" he asked, flipping on the light.\n\n\"Don't—\" Maya started, but it was too late. The shadows fled, and with them, her discovery.\n\n\"I was looking at something beautiful,\" she said softly.\n\nHe didn't understand. How could he? Beauty, she'd learned, doesn't always seek the light. Sometimes it hides in the places we forget to look, waiting for eyes patient enough to find it in the dark.\n\nMaya smiled and turned off the light again. There it was, her secret color, blooming in the shadows like a flower that only opens at night.",

She called it *Vantus*.\n\nShe dragged her easel outside, mixing lamp black and ultramarine, but the canvas remained flat. The shadow under the apple tree, however, hummed. It felt heavy, like velvet soaked in time.\n\nDesperate, Elara reached out to touch the shadow cast by her own hand against the grass. Her fingers didn't pass through cool air; they brushed against something warm and viscous. The color stained her skin, not with pigment, but with a sensation of absolute silence.\n\nThe sun dipped lower, stretching the world’s shadows long and thin. The lawn flooded with *Vantus*.

It possessed a subtle, shimmering quality, a hue she'd never encountered.\n\nShe dipped her brush into black paint, then into indigo, trying to replicate it. Nothing came close. This new color, which she mentally dubbed \"Umbra-luna,\" was elusive. It wasn't a pigment; it was an absence, yet simultaneously a presence. It pulsed with a quiet energy, a deep, velvety violet-black with hints of something akin to starlight trapped within.\n\nElara experimented. She moved objects, observing how Umbra-luna clung to the edges of obscurity, intensifying in the densest pockets of shade. It never appeared in direct light, fading instantly the moment a beam touched it. Her initial frustration gave way to awe. This wasn't a color to be mixed or painted; it was a phenomenon to be observed.\n\nShe spent weeks documenting its nuances, sketching its ethereal forms. Umbra-luna became her secret, a hidden beauty accessible only to those who dared to look beyond the obvious. It taught her that true artistry wasn't just about what you could create, but what you could perceive in the world's quiet, overlooked corners.",

In the shadow cast by a vase on her table, she saw a hue she had never seen before. It was as if the darkness had taken on a life of its own, revealing a deep, rich color that seemed to vibrate with an otherworldly energy.\n\nIntrigued, Lena began to experiment, manipulating the light sources in her studio to create different shadow patterns.

She incorporated it into her art, using it to add depth and nuance to her pieces. Her studio became a kaleidoscope of shadows, with Umbra dancing across the walls and canvases.

If caught, the item is returned to the other player. If dropped or not caught, the item's final resting place determines the score. Points are awarded based on the item's proximity to the opponent's starting position. \n\nThe game ends after a set number of rounds or when a player reaches a predetermined score.

Build your meals around whole grains like brown rice, oats, and quinoa; fruits such as berries, apples, and pears; and non-starchy vegetables like kale, spinach, peppers, and broccoli.\n\n**Plan your portions:**\nWomen should eat 2-3 cups of vegetables daily, 1½-2 cups of fruit, and 5-6 ounces of protein, while men need 3-4 cups of vegetables, 2-2½ cups of fruit, and 6-7 ounces of protein. At least half of your grains should be whole grains, with adults eating about 3-3½ ounces daily.\n\n**Fiber goals:**\nExperts recommend a minimum of 14 grams of dietary fiber per 1,000 calories consumed, which equates to 28 grams in a 2,000-calorie diet. Your 25g target is achievable with fiber-rich vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes.\n\n**Meal structure:**\nEat 5-6 meals per day, focusing on healthy foods like fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and lean protein.

Replace the default username and password with a strong, unique combination.\n\n2. **Set a Strong Wi-Fi Password:** Create a password that’s at least 12 characters long, using a mix of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid common words or phrases.\n\n3. **Enable WPA3 Encryption:** In your router settings, select WPA3 as the security protocol. If WPA3 isn’t available, use WPA2-AES (avoid WPA and WEP, as they’re less secure).\n\n4. **Disable WPS:** Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is vulnerable to attacks. Turn it off in your router’s settings.\n\n5. **Set Up a Guest Network:** Create a separate network for guests. This keeps your main network private and limits access to your devices. Enable WPA3 or WPA2 for the guest network and set a different password.\n\n6. **Update Router Firmware:** Check for firmware updates in your router’s admin panel and install them. Enable automatic updates if available to ensure ongoing security.\n\n7. **Disable Remote Management:** Turn off remote access to your router’s admin panel to prevent outsiders from changing settings.\n\n8. **Enable Firewall:** Activate your router’s built-in firewall for an added layer of protection.\n\n9. **Change the Network Name (SSID):** Avoid using default or identifiable names.

The Climate Action Tracker calls this \"the most aggressive, comprehensive, and consequential climate policy rollback\" ever analyzed, with the Trump Administration withdrawing from the Paris Agreement.\n\n**EU's 2040 Target:** The EU Council agreed on a binding 90% reduction in net GHG emissions by 2040, with adjustments addressing competitiveness concerns and flexibility for member states.\n\n**China's Progress:** China committed to reduce emissions 7%-10% below peak levels by 2035—its first absolute, economy-wide emissions target. UNEP projections suggest China's emissions may have peaked in 2025.\n\n**Global Deployment:** Renewables are expected to surpass coal by late 2025 or mid-2026 to become the largest source of global electricity generation. Globally, 4.5 terawatts of new wind and solar are expected over the next five years—a 67% increase from the previous five-year period.\n\n**Impact on Targets:** UNEP's Emissions Gap Report finds warming projections are now 2.3-2.5°C based on NDC implementation, but methodological updates and U.S. withdrawal mean new NDCs have \"barely moved the needle.\" Nations remain far from the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C goal.",

This milestone was driven by falling costs, easing supply bottlenecks, and clearer policy signals, especially in emerging markets like Africa and Southeast Asia. China alone installed 360 GW of wind and solar in 2024, accounting for over half of global additions.\n\n- **New Climate Finance Pledges:** European leaders pledged $15.5 billion in new climate finance to support renewable infrastructure in Africa, aiming to provide millions with clean energy. This investment is critical for accelerating the energy transition in regions expected to drive 80% of future energy demand growth.\n\n- **Policy Shifts and Forecasts:** The International Energy Agency (IEA) revised its renewable energy growth forecast upward for regions like ASEAN and the Middle East, citing faster-than-expected policy implementation and ambitious national targets. However, the world remains off track to triple global renewable capacity by 2030, as agreed at COP28, due to persistent policy and implementation gaps.\n\n- **Impact on Emissions:** The rapid expansion of renewables has already reduced reliance on coal, with global coal-fired generation declining by 3% in the first half of 2025—the first such drop since 2020. This shift is expected to continue, with renewables projected to supply 19% of global electricity by 2026, up from 4% a decade earlier.

India accused Pakistan of supporting cross-border terrorism, which Pakistan denied.\n\n**Events:** India launched strikes targeting terrorism-related infrastructure of Pakistan-based militant groups Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir. The Indian air strikes triggered an aerial battle involving more than 114 aircraft—72 from India and 42 from Pakistan—described as the largest beyond visual range engagement on the India-Pakistan border.\n\n**Current Status:** After the four-day military conflict, both countries announced a ceasefire following hotline communication between their military operations directors on 10 May 2025. As 2025 concludes, India-Pakistan relations remain in crisis: dialogue is limited, a key water-sharing treaty is suspended, and commercial flights between the countries are disrupted.

Krebs cycle (mitochondrial matrix): each pyruvate is decarboxylated to acetyl-CoA, which enters the cycle. Per glucose, two turns produce 2 ATP (as GTP), 6 NADH, and 2 FADH₂, releasing 4 CO₂.\n\n3. Oxidative phosphorylation (inner mitochondrial membrane): NADH and FADH₂ donate electrons to the electron transport chain. Proton pumping creates an electrochemical gradient; protons flow back through ATP synthase, driving production of ~34 ATP.

It occurs in three main stages: **glycolysis**, the **Krebs cycle**, and **oxidative phosphorylation**.\n\n1. **Glycolysis** takes place in the cytoplasm and breaks down one molecule of glucose (6 carbons) into two molecules of pyruvate (3 carbons each). This produces a net gain of 2 ATP and 2 NADH, which carry high-energy electrons.\n\n2. The **Krebs cycle** (or citric acid cycle) occurs in the mitochondria. Pyruvate is first converted into acetyl-CoA, which enters the cycle. Here, acetyl-CoA is fully oxidized, releasing CO₂, and producing 2 ATP, 6 NADH, and 2 FADH₂ per glucose molecule. These electron carriers are crucial for the next stage.\n\n3. **Oxidative phosphorylation** happens in the inner mitochondrial membrane. NADH and FADH₂ donate electrons to the electron transport chain, creating a proton gradient. This gradient drives ATP synthase to produce most of the cell’s ATP—about 28–34 molecules per glucose. Oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor, forming water.\n\nIn summary, cellular respiration efficiently harvests energy from glucose through these interconnected stages, powering cellular activities.",

This technology allowed individuals to record, replay, and even share their memories with others. At first, it was hailed as a breakthrough for therapy and education. However, as the technology became ubiquitous, societal norms began to shift. People began to rely on Reliving their fondest memories, rather than creating new ones. Relationships became transactional, with individuals replaying their partner's fondest memories of them to rekindle feelings. The concept of personal identity became blurred as people began to live vicariously through others' experiences. As a result, a new class system emerged, with \"Memory Merchants\" controlling the most coveted experiences. The lines between reality and nostalgia began to blur, and society struggled to adapt to a world where memories, not experiences, became the ultimate currency. The impact on mental health and genuine human connection was profound, raising questions about the value of living in the present.",

For instance, one player's destiny might be to \"amass the most 'Star Dust' resources,\" while another's is to \"ensure the 'Gravity Uplink' is the first major component built,\" even if it's not optimal for the group. Players cannot reveal their destinies but can negotiate, offer trades, or subtly influence group decisions to benefit their secret agenda.\n\nThe win condition is two-tiered: The entire group *must* achieve the main collaborative objective. If this fails, everyone loses. However, for an individual player to win, they *also* must have successfully completed their personal Destiny Card at the moment the main goal is met. This creates a delicate balance: players need the group to succeed, but they must also prioritize their potentially conflicting personal goals to truly claim victory.",

          "text": "Safely replacing a bicycle tire and tube involves a few key steps and tools.\n\n**Tools Needed:**\nYou will need tire levers (preferably plastic to avoid rim damage), a bike pump (or CO2 inflator), and a new inner tube of the correct size. A wrench may be required if your wheel isn't quick-release.\n\n**Process:**\n1.  **Remove the Wheel:** First, remove the wheel from your bicycle. For rear wheels, shift to the highest gear before removal.\n2.  **Deflate and Remove Old Tube:** Fully deflate the existing tube. Use tire levers to carefully pry one bead of the tire off the rim, starting away from the valve. Once one side is off, remove the old inner tube.\n3.  **Inspect for Damage:** Thoroughly inspect the inside of the tire casing and the rim strip for any sharp objects (glass, thorns, etc.) that caused the puncture. Run your fingers carefully along the inside of the tire.\n4.  **Install New Tube:** Slightly inflate the new tube to give it shape. Insert the valve stem through the rim hole, then tuck the rest of the tube inside the tire.\n5.  **Re-seat Tire:** Carefully work one tire bead back onto the rim. Then, starting opposite the valve, gently push the second bead back onto the rim, ensuring the tube isn't pinched between the tire and rim.\n6.  **Inflate:** Inflate the tire gradually, checking that the tire bead is evenly seated on the rim. Inflate to the recommended pressure found on the tire sidewall.\n7.  **Reinstall Wheel:** Reattach the wheel to your bike.\n\n**Troubleshooting Tips:**\n*   **Pinch Flats:** If you get two small, parallel holes (snakebites), it indicates a pinch flat, usually caused by under-inflation or hitting a curb.\n*   **Difficulty Seating Bead:** If the tire bead struggles to seat, deflate slightly, apply soapy water to the bead, and re-inflate.\n*   **Valve Leaks:** If the tube loses air but has no punctures, check for a loose valve core by applying soapy water to the valve stem; bubbles indicate a leak.",

However, significant skepticism remains regarding Hamas's willingness to disarm, and the plan is silent on how this will be achieved.\n\nIn **Sudan**, peace efforts have resumed in Cairo, with Egypt and the United Nations calling for a nationwide humanitarian truce as the war nears its three-year mark. Regional and international mediators are working to coordinate fragmented peace talks and secure an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, though the conflict persists despite reported agreements on truces.\n\nIn the **Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)**, high-level meetings are underway in Lomé, Togo, to advance peace efforts in the eastern region, chaired by the African Union's appointed mediator. These talks follow a Rwanda-DRC peace agreement signed in Washington in November 2025, though tensions remain high and UN experts note that peace processes are currently stalled due to disagreements and differing interpretations of agreements.\n\nRegarding **Yemen**, UN Special Envoy Hans Grundberg has held diplomatic meetings in Riyadh, focusing on economic stability and prisoner exchanges as critical steps toward peace. A fragile, unofficial truce has been in place since April 2022, and efforts are ongoing to build on a December agreement for prisoner releases. However, recent political developments and territorial shifts indicate ongoing instability.\n\nIn **Myanmar**, peace talks have reportedly begun following a significant rebel victory in January 2026, leading to a ceasefire and Chinese-led negotiations between the Three Brotherhood Alliance and the military government. However, the military government has not commented on the potential for a lasting settlement, and elections conducted by the junta are viewed as a way to legitimize military rule amid the ongoing civil war.",

          "text": "Here is a concise update on the current status of major global peace negotiations as of January 2026:\n\n**Israel-Hamas War:**  \nA US-brokered ceasefire is in its second phase, focusing on demilitarization, technocratic governance, and reconstruction in Gaza. Hamas has released all living hostages and most remains, while Israel has withdrawn partially and increased aid. However, the ceasefire remains fragile, with ongoing violations and disputes over the return of the last deceased hostage and Hamas’s disarmament. A \"Board of Peace\" is being established to oversee Gaza’s transition, but Israel has objected to some US announcements regarding its composition.\n\n**Russia-Ukraine War:**  \nDiplomatic efforts continue, with a US-led peace plan reportedly 90% complete. Ukraine’s delegation is in the US for further talks, but Russia remains unwilling to compromise on its maximalist demands, including territorial concessions. Despite optimism from Western and Ukrainian officials, Russia’s stance and recent military advances suggest significant obstacles remain.\n\n**Sudan:**  \nPeace talks resumed in Cairo in mid-January, with Egypt, the UN, and the US calling for a nationwide humanitarian truce. The warring parties—the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces—have yet to agree on a ceasefire, and the humanitarian crisis continues to worsen. Mediators emphasize the need to protect Sudan’s unity and state institutions.\n\n**Yemen:**  \nThe Southern Transitional Council (STC), a major separatist group, announced its dissolution in early January, easing some tensions. However, Yemen’s peace process remains deeply fragile, with ongoing divisions and regional rivalries, particularly between Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The UN continues to push for a nationwide ceasefire and inclusive political talks, but progress is slow.\n\n**Ethiopia-Tigray:**  \nThe November 2022 Pretoria Agreement remains in effect, but implementation is incomplete. Key issues—such as the return of displaced people, disarmament, and regional governance—are stalled. While large-scale violence has decreased, tensions persist, and the risk of renewed conflict remains due to unresolved political and humanitarian challenges.",

This technique allows authors to explore complex themes—such as history, politics, and human experience—through a lens that transcends conventional realism.\n\nGarcía Márquez's novel follows seven generations of the Buendía family in the fictional town of Macondo, weaving together extraordinary events like levitation, prophetic dreams, and characters living impossibly long lives alongside the everyday struggles of life in Latin America. The book became a landmark of 20th-century literature and helped bring international attention to Latin American authors during the \"Latin American Boom\" of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nGarcía Márquez won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982, with the committee citing his novels and short stories \"in which the fantastic and the realistic are combined in a richly composed world of imagination.\"",

García Márquez is considered the founder of this literary style[1], which blends fantastical or supernatural elements with realistic narrative as if they were ordinary occurrences. This approach was heavily influenced by his grandmother's storytelling method—she delivered even the most fantastic statements as irrefutable truth, a deadpan style that shaped his most famous work[2].\n\n*One Hundred Years of Solitude* became a landmark achievement in the Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s[3]. The novel achieved extraordinary commercial success, selling over 50 million copies worldwide[2], and earned García Márquez international acclaim.

Meiosis II separates sister chromatids, similar to mitosis, but results in four distinct cells, each with half the original chromosome number.\n\nIn summary, mitosis produces identical diploid cells for growth and repair, while meiosis generates unique haploid gametes for reproduction.",

Open both hoods and locate the batteries\n\n**Connection Order (Critical):**\n1. **Red to Dead** – Connect one red clamp to the dead battery's positive (+) terminal\n2. **Red to Good** – Connect the other red clamp to the working battery's positive (+) terminal\n3. **Black to Good** – Connect one black clamp to the working battery's negative (-) terminal\n4. **Black to Ground** – Connect the other black clamp to an unpainted metal surface on the dead car (like a bolt or bracket) – NOT the dead battery\n\n**Starting:**\n1. Start the working car and let it run for 2-3 minutes\n2. Try starting the dead car\n3. If it starts, let both cars run for a few minutes\n\n**Disconnection Order (Reverse):**\nRemove cables in reverse order: ground, negative, positive on good battery, positive on dead battery.\n\nDrive the jumped car for at least 15-20 minutes to recharge the battery.",

Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's two largest cities, both competed for the capital designation, but neither was considered ideal due to their coastal vulnerability to naval attack.[5] Rather than selecting either city, Australia's leaders made the radical decision to construct an entirely new capital city from the ground up.[5]\n\nDesigned by American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin, Canberra was formally established and named in 1913, with construction completed by 1927.[3] The city features a planned layout influenced by the garden city movement, with geometric designs aligned with topographical landmarks like Black Mountain and Mount Ainslie.[3]\n\nAs Australia's seat of government, Canberra houses Parliament House, Government House, the High Court, and numerous national institutions including the Australian War Memorial, National Gallery, and National Museum.[3] As of June 2024, the city had an estimated population of 473,855.[3]",

Hosts leave one empty chair labeled for a new neighbor or someone alone.\n- Evening: a 60‑minute “screen pause” at the table — phones away, conversation prompts passed around, and a short gratitude circle where one person names a local good deed they noticed.\n- All day: barter board for skills (babysitting, lawn help), seed-and-recipe swap stations, and optional volunteer shifts at local food programs.\nSymbol: a cloth napkin patch sewn onto doors or coats to indicate participation.\n\nOutcome: increases neighborly care, reduces isolation, and converts shared meals into lasting local support.",

Hand-tighten the lug nuts.\n\n7. **Lower the Car:** Carefully lower the jack until the tire touches the ground but still bears some weight.\n\n8. **Tighten Lug Nuts:** Use the wrench to tighten the nuts in a star pattern for even pressure. Lower the car completely and give the nuts a final tighten.\n\n9. **Stow Equipment:** Put the flat tire, jack, and tools back in your car. Check the spare’s pressure if possible.\n\nDrive cautiously—spares are often temporary and have speed/distance limits. Get your flat tire repaired or replaced as soon as you can.",

Next, list all your monthly expenses, categorizing them into fixed (e.g., rent, loan payments) and variable (e.g., groceries, entertainment) costs. Review past bank statements or credit card bills to accurately estimate variable expenses, and don't forget to account for annual expenses by dividing them by 12.\n\nSubtract your total expenses from your total income to determine if you have a surplus or deficit.

Finally, consistently track your spending throughout the month and adjust your budget as needed to ensure it remains realistic and effective. Reviewing your budget regularly helps you stay on track and achieve your financial objectives.The steps to create a basic budget for personal finances are as follows:\n\nFirst, determine your total monthly income from all sources. This includes your net pay and any other regular earnings.\n\nNext, list all your monthly expenses. Categorize these into fixed expenses, which remain constant (e.g., rent, loan payments), and variable expenses, which fluctuate (e.g., groceries, entertainment).

Avoid scrubbing to prevent the stain from setting deeper into the carpet fibers.\n\nFor treatment, you have several effective options:\n\n**Dish Soap & White Vinegar Method**: Mix a tablespoon of hand dishwashing soap and a tablespoon of white vinegar to two cups of warm water. Apply this solution to the stain, blot repeatedly until the stain lifts, then rinse with cold water.\n\n**Hydrogen Peroxide Method**: Mix two-parts hydrogen peroxide to one-part dishwashing soap. Test on a hidden area first, as peroxide has mild bleaching properties. Apply to the stain, blot, and repeat until gone.\n\n**Salt or Baking Soda**: Blot to remove excess liquid and cover the stain with salt. Leave for a few minutes before vacuuming the salt. It will absorb the red wine and pull the colour away from the carpet. Alternatively, make a paste with three parts baking soda and one part water, apply to the stain and leave it to dry before vacuuming.\n\nImmediate action can significantly reduce the stain's impact, so treat spills as soon as possible.",

She watched the mountains below—stoic, patient, *permanent*—and felt a longing deep in her vaporous heart.\n\n\"I want to be a rock,\" she announced to the sun one morning.\n\nThe sun laughed, warm and golden. \"Clouds become rain, dear. That's the way of things.\"\n\nBut Nimbus was stubborn. She squeezed herself tighter and tighter, refusing to rain, growing dense and gray. The other clouds whispered that she'd gone mad.\n\nOne winter, she drifted over a frozen peak and finally let go—not as rain, but as snow. She fell softly onto the mountain and waited. Years passed. The snow compressed into ice, and the ice pressed into the ancient stone.\n\nA thousand years later, a hiker picked up a small, cloudy-white quartz from that very peak. Inside, tiny bubbles of ancient air swirled like miniature storms.\n\nNimbus had done it. She was finally still.\n\nAnd sometimes, when the light hit just right, she almost seemed to glow.",

The cloud gathered moisture, growing darker and heavier, pulling in every water droplet for miles. Finally, too heavy to float, Nimbus fell—not as rain, but as tremendous hailstones that clattered onto the mountain.\n\nOver centuries, those hailstones became part of a glacier, which ground itself into sediment, which compressed into stone. Nimbus had become a rock at last.\n\nBut sometimes, when the wind whistles through the mountain pass, the rock remembers what it felt like to dance across the sky, and wonders if perhaps being light had its own kind of magic.",

However, Ukrainian forces achieved a significant tactical victory by recapturing the key city of Kupiansk in late 2025. Ukraine also maintains a small foothold in Russia's Kursk region and continues long-range drone strikes against Russian rear logistics.\n\nThe humanitarian situation is critical.

However, winter weather conditions have reportedly hindered some Russian advances. Ukrainian forces have recently advanced near Kupyansk, Slovyansk, and in the Kostyantynivka-Druzhkivka tactical area, successfully regaining control of Kupiansk. Ukraine also effectively counters Russian drone adaptations and conducts its own drone strikes, targeting Russian military and industrial facilities, including an oil depot and a chemical plant.\n\nRussia continues its extensive aerial assault campaign, primarily using drones and missiles to target Ukraine's critical energy infrastructure. A major strike on January 13 involved hundreds of drones and missiles, causing widespread power outages across several Ukrainian regions, including Kyiv. These attacks have severely damaged Ukraine's energy grid, significantly reducing its generating capacity.\n\nDiplomatically, Ukrainian peace negotiators are in the United States for talks on a proposed peace agreement. Russia, however, has expressed little interest in de-escalation, with its Foreign Minister indicating objectives that extend to several more Ukrainian oblasts. A localized ceasefire was recently agreed upon to allow repairs on a critical backup power line at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.

The child giggles, unaware of Toasty’s mild exasperation.\n\nBy evening, the kitchen fills with the scent of dinner. Toasty listens to the clatter of pots and the murmur of conversation, feeling a quiet pride. It may never speak, but it witnesses the small, warm moments that define a home. As the lights dim, Toasty powers down, content in its role—guardian of breakfast, architect of crunch. *\"Tomorrow,\"* it thinks, *\"more toast.\"*",

Its slender body is covered in microscopic, shimmering scales that reflect and refract light, allowing it to blend into the cave's kaleidoscopic surroundings. The Luminawing's diet consists of a unique form of bioluminescent plankton that it filters from the cave's crystal-clear waters.\n\nThis creature possesses the special ability to control and manipulate light across the electromagnetic spectrum. It can emit intense bursts of color to communicate with other Luminawings, create dazzling displays to attract prey, or even generate blindingly bright flashes to deter predators. The Luminawing's most remarkable ability, however, is its capacity to store and release energy in the form of luminescent orbs, which it can use to illuminate dark passages or create complex patterns on the cave walls. As it flits through the darkness, the Luminawing leaves a trail of shimmering, ethereal light in its wake.",

Its fur shifts colors like a prism, reflecting the hues of its surroundings—deep blues, violets, and emeralds—making it nearly invisible among the glowing flora. Lumivores thrive in the damp, misty understories of these forests, often near hidden thermal springs that keep the air warm and humid.\n\nTheir diet consists almost entirely of light itself. Lumivores absorb the radiance from glowing plants, fireflies, and even moonlight, converting it into energy through specialized, jewel-like scales along their spines. They can also \"eat\" emotions tied to light—joy, wonder, or nostalgia—leaving behind a faint, soothing hum in their wake.\n\nLumivores possess the unique ability to manipulate light and shadow. They can bend beams of light to create illusions, confuse predators, or even weave temporary bridges of solidified radiance. Their eyes, which glow like embers, can hypnotize prey or calm agitated creatures. Legends say that encountering a Lumivore brings good fortune, as their presence purifies the air and leaves the forest more vibrant than before.",

Mornings begin without the hassle of commutes—people simply teleport from their beds to offices, cafes, or parks. Rush hour is obsolete; instead, cities hum with quiet efficiency as individuals appear and disappear in designated teleportation hubs.\n\nWorkplaces adapt to global collaboration. Meetings feature colleagues teleporting in from different continents, their presence as seamless as a video call but with the intimacy of face-to-face interaction. Lunches are spontaneous, with friends teleporting to a beachside bistro or a mountaintop café.\n\nHomes are more private, as teleportation replaces front doors. Security systems rely on biometric scans to prevent unauthorized arrivals. Travel for leisure is effortless—vacations start the moment you teleport to a tropical island or a bustling foreign market.\n\nYet challenges arise. Urban sprawl increases as people teleport to remote areas, blurring the lines between city and countryside. Crime evolves, with teleportation-enabled theft or intrusions requiring advanced safeguards. Social dynamics shift, too; spontaneity replaces planning, and the world feels both vast and intimately connected.\n\nEvening brings a return to local communities, as people teleport home for dinner or to gather under the stars, their day a tapestry of global experiences woven into a single, extraordinary life.",

A graphene-reinforced geodesic dome encloses the city, collecting solar energy and channeling prevailing winds through vertical-axis turbines integrated into the structure. Inside, algae-filled bioreactor glass panels line every façade, producing oxygen, biofuel, and protein-rich food.  \n\nWaste is eliminated: organic matter is pyrolyzed into biochar for rooftop hydroponics; minerals are recovered via plasma gasification and fed to 3-D printers that build new modules on demand. A closed-loop water system harvests humidity and desalinates seawater using wave-powered reverse osmosis; greywater irrigates cascading vertical gardens that cool the air naturally.  \n\nMobility is three-dimensional: magnetic-levitation pods glide along the underside of skybridges, while pedestrian walkways prioritize algae-rubber moving sidewalks. Districts are zoned by temperature and light, reducing HVAC demand 70 %. A blockchain-based energy ledger lets residents trade surplus kilowatts or algae credits instantly, stabilizing the microgrid.  \n\nThe entire city is carbon-negative, sinking more CO₂ than it emits, and is designed to disassemble cleanly, leaving only coral-enhancing reef structures behind.",

Its skyline is a blend of vertical gardens and solar-glass towers that generate more energy than they consume. Every building is clad in photovoltaic panels and living walls, purifying the air and providing insulation.\n\nAt the city’s heart lies a vast central park, designed as a carbon sink with native flora and underground water reservoirs. Pedestrian boulevards, bike lanes, and autonomous electric shuttles replace cars, eliminating emissions and reducing noise. Underground maglev trains connect districts in minutes, powered entirely by renewable energy.\n\nWaste is a relic of the past—Neo-Verda operates on a circular economy. Smart bins sort and recycle 100% of waste, while organic matter is composted or converted into biogas. Rainwater is harvested, filtered, and reused, and desalination plants provide fresh water without harming marine ecosystems.\n\nAI-driven systems optimize energy use, adjusting lighting, heating, and cooling in real time. Rooftop farms and vertical agriculture ensure food is grown locally, cutting transport emissions. Public spaces are abundant, fostering community and well-being.\n\nNeo-Verda is not just sustainable—it’s regenerative, giving back more to the planet than it takes.",

The holiday encourages communities to gather in parks, community centers, or neighborhoods for exchange events.\n\n**How to celebrate:**\n\n- **Skill Swaps**: Offer your talents (cooking lessons, guitar tutorials, gardening help) in exchange for someone else's skills\n- **Object Exchanges**: Bring gently used items you no longer need and trade them for things others offer – books, kitchen tools, clothing, plants\n- **Time Banking**: Commit to helping someone with a task (babysitting, home repairs, errands) and receive help in return\n- **Gratitude Letters**: Write handwritten notes to three people who've impacted your life and deliver them personally or by mail\n- **Community Meals**: Potluck gatherings where everyone contributes a dish and shares stories of gratitude\n\nThe holiday's symbol is the infinity loop, representing the continuous cycle of giving and receiving. People wear orange ribbons to show participation. No money changes hands – the focus is on recognizing abundance in what we already have and strengthening community bonds through generosity.

Using techniques inspired by Kintsugi (gold joinery) or visible mending, participants fix these items using bright gold lacquer or colorful thread. The goal is to highlight the damage, transforming the break into the object's most beautiful feature.\n\nOn an interpersonal level, the holiday is the designated time for \"The Golden Apology.\" People reach out to estranged friends or family members to mend bridges, focusing on future connection rather than past blame.\n\nThe day concludes with a \"Harvest of Scraps\" feast. Families prepare elaborate meals using only leftovers and ingredients about to expire, proving that with care and creativity, nothing is truly wasted.",

A cobblestone path, overgrown but intact, led deeper into the forest, where the ruins of a forgotten city peeked through the foliage.\n\nLena followed the path, her heart pounding. She met a girl named Mira, who wore a dress stitched from petals and spoke of a time when humans and magic had lived side by side. \"This place is called Elyria,\" Mira said. \"It fades when the outside world forgets it.\"\n\nAs the sun set, the city’s ruins glowed, revealing murals of a history Lena had never learned. But with the first light of dawn, the path home reappeared. Lena stepped back into her own world, clutching a single glowing leaf—proof, she hoped, that Elyria was real.\n\nShe returned every evening after that, determined to keep its memory alive.",

These help the model identify unusual behavior.\n\n4. **Choose an Anomaly Detection Technique:**\n   - **Statistical Methods:** Use Z-score or IQR to flag outliers based on standard deviations or percentiles.\n   - **Machine Learning Models:** Train unsupervised models like Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, or Autoencoders, which learn normal patterns and flag deviations.\n   - **Clustering:** Use DBSCAN or K-means to identify points that don’t fit well into any cluster.\n\n5. **Train the Model:** For unsupervised methods, train on the majority of the data (assumed to be normal). For supervised methods, use labeled data to teach the model what fraud looks like.\n\n6. **Evaluate:** Test the model on a holdout dataset, using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to measure performance. Adjust thresholds to balance false positives and false negatives.\n\n7. **Deploy and Monitor:** Integrate the model into your transaction system to flag suspicious activity in real time. Continuously update the model with new data to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.",

Instead of using a single decision boundary (e.g., 0.5) for all inputs, select different thresholds for different demographic groups. This allows you to equalize specific metrics, such as ensuring equal False Negative Rates (Equal Opportunity) or balancing the proportion of positive predictions (Demographic Parity) across groups.\n\n**Calibration** ensures that the predicted probabilities reflect true correctness likelihoods equally for all subgroups. If a model is 70% confident, it should be correct 70% of the time, regardless of the sensitive attribute.\n\n**Reject Option Classification** involves identifying predictions near the decision boundary (uncertain cases) and assigning favorable outcomes to unprivileged groups in that specific region to correct historical imbalances.\n\nFinally, implement **human-in-the-loop** workflows to review high-risk or low-confidence predictions.

But despite the comforting familiarity of the ship's routines, something felt off. Tools had gone missing from the engineering decks, and strange noises echoed through the corridors at night. Some whispered of \"The Drifters,\" a mythical group of malcontents who supposedly lurked in the ship's shadows. Ortega's instincts told her it was more than just rumor. And then, the body was found, floating in a storage compartment deep in the ship's cargo bay, a cryptic message scrawled on the wall beside it. The investigation was about to upend the fragile peace on the Aurora.",

After blotting, dab with cold water then spread salt over the affected area. The crystals draw wine out of the cotton.

Over two to five minutes, the red will start to fade before your eyes.\n\n**Alternative methods:** Club soda's minerals help absorb and break up red wine molecules.

To avoid catastrophic consequences, I recommend that individuals, organizations, and governments invest in renewable energy, reduce waste, and adopt eco-friendly practices.\n\nSpecifically, I suggest accelerating the transition to clean energy sources, such as solar and fusion power, and promoting sustainable land use practices. Additionally, implementing circular economies and reducing consumption can significantly minimize waste. By making these changes today, we can mitigate the worst effects of climate change and create a more resilient and thriving future for generations to come. By working together, we can build a better tomorrow, and I'm confident that the efforts made today will have a profound impact on the world of 2150 and beyond.",

By 2043 the atmospheric carbon ledger flips from asset to debt and every subsequent dollar spent carries an interest rate imposed by physics. Price every decision—hamburger, highway, haircut—at its full greenhouse cost and embed that price in daily life the way you already embed calories or minutes. Once carbon is priced truthfully, markets pivot faster than politics; the technologies you already prototype in labs scale overnight. The bonus: social inequality narrows because the same accounting exposes unpaid human labor and hidden externalities. Make the price honest before 2030 and you avoid the rationing, relocation, and resentment that define my century.",

By 2150, the most critical challenges—climate collapse, resource wars, and social inequality—stem from unchecked population growth in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The Earth’s carrying capacity was exceeded long before technology could compensate, and the consequences are still being felt.\n\nInvest in **education and empowerment for all genders**, especially women and girls. When people have access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities, birth rates naturally stabilize. Support policies that make family planning universally accessible and destigmatize smaller families. Prioritize quality of life over quantity of people—this shift alone could have prevented the worst of the 22nd century’s crises.\n\nThe future isn’t just about cleaner energy or smarter cities; it’s about ensuring there are enough resources for everyone to thrive. Start now: advocate for global equity, challenge consumption-driven economies, and redefine progress beyond GDP. The choices you make about population today will determine whether the future is one of scarcity or shared prosperity.",

          "text": "This is a question about general financial planning principles, which is stable knowledge I can answer directly without needing to search.\n\n**Creating a 5-Year Savings Budget for a Major Purchase:**\n\n1. **Define your goal**: Determine the exact amount needed (e.g., $50,000 for a down payment). Research current prices for your target purchase.\n\n2. **Calculate monthly savings**: Divide your goal by 60 months. For $50,000, that's approximately $833/month.\n\n3. **Track your income and expenses**: List all monthly income sources and categorize spending (housing, food, transportation, entertainment, etc.).\n\n4. **Identify cuts**: Reduce discretionary spending—dining out, subscriptions, impulse purchases. Redirect these funds to savings.\n\n5. **Automate transfers**: Set up automatic deposits to a dedicated high-yield savings account on payday. This removes temptation to spend.\n\n6. **Create budget categories**: Use the 50/30/20 rule as a starting point—50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings. Adjust the savings portion upward if possible.\n\n7. **Build in flexibility**: Account for irregular expenses (holidays, car repairs) so they don't derail your plan.\n\n8. **Review quarterly**: Reassess progress, adjust for income changes, and stay motivated by tracking milestones.\n\n9. **Boost income**: Consider side work or selling unused items to accelerate savings.\n\nConsistency matters more than perfection—small, regular contributions compound over time.",
